# NodeExpressAngularMySQL-Scaffold
A simple scaffold for a node.js / Express / Angular / MySQL web application

Once you have cloned the repository enter the login details for your database in server/server.js. You will also need to amend the form fields and methods accordingly to fit with the particular table with which you would like to work. 

This is not intended to be any form of production-ready solution (no implementation of SSL or secure storage of login details, for instance), but aims to show how you can link a node.js/Express back end with a MySQL database and Angular front-end.
